                <h1>Simple Task Management to get your To-Dos DONE!</h1>
                <p> We started out as two best friends who love to spend time organizing ANYTHING!.  Our hobby turned into a bustling business of home organization services for hire.  We both love to use technology to boost productivity so we thought why not create a simple task management app to let people take more control of their lives. </p>
                <p> If you're like us, we get immense satisfaction from writing (or typing) lists and then checking things off that list.  What a sense of accomplishment! </p>
                <p> We truly hope you enjoy our little side project as much as we have enjoyed creating it.</p>
                <p> Feel free to reach out if you are in need of professional organization help!  We come to you. </p>
                <p> Happy Tasking!</p>
